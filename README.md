Passionate programmer with proven experience in C#, PHP, SQL, JavaScript.
Interested in Web Development as a whole. Always looking at new frameworks and web-technologies on the rise. Working Professionally as a SSE and building side projects using Symfony 4, Angular 8 & MySQL as dev. tech. I love learning about programming principles and how it affects our project outcome (maintainability is my priority).

My Favourite quote is:
"Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning."
